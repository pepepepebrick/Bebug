# What if your "Code" could be a "Bug"?🪲

This is an interactive system built with **TouchDesigner** and **VS Code** that transforms your code into a visualized "Bug" in Real-time.

## 概念描述

What if your programming could actually "hatch" a beetle? This interactive system breathes life into your code. By automatically reading characters directly from #VSCode, it tracks the lifecycle of a beetle—from egg and larva to pupa and adult.


Beyond randomizing colors, sizes, and shapes, you can even choose between species like stag beetles, rhinoceros beetles, scarabs, or weevils. Whether you're building websites, developing apps, or live-coding music, this companion stays by your side, letting developers “BeBug” while they DeBug.


For this workflow, I integrated #VSCode with @touchdesigner to handle the coding. VS Code is incredibly versatile with its support for various languages and extensions, making the development much more efficient. For example, I used #ScriptSOP nodes and #Python to generate the 3D coordinates and geometric attributes for the insects' bodies and legs. I then utilized #ScriptDAT to loop the code every 80 characters, converting it into a structured data table.


I’m thrilled to collaborate with Microsoft Developer on this! The project is now open-source and available on my #GitHub. Let’s make coding a lot more fun!
